# DA-1-SQL-Covid19-insights
Covid19 insights are very crucial as we faced such a ruthless pandemic. This project will give you the SQL queries used to gain insight on the data of COVID-19 provided by every country. Some insights are like total_deaths to total_cases ratio for every country, and so on.

# IDE
Used MicroSoft SQL Server Management Studio for running SQL queries. The excel files were imported in the SSMS through SQL DB Drive from Microsoft Server Management. The file imported were then ready to use as they were processed by SSMS.

I have learnt this from a Data Analyst Course provided by freecodecamp.org (Alex the Analyst)
